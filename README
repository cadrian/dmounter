Manage your mountpoints with dmenu

http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/

Usage: put your mountpoints in .map: three fields <share> <point> <type> where

 * <share> is the device to mount (e.g. /dev/sdb1 or //WINDOWS_SERVER/point)
 * <point> is the name of the mount directory; also used as key for dmenu
 * <type> is one of the supported mounting type (currently cifs, vfat, and ntfs)

Example:

--8<--------
/dev/sdb1 usbkey vfat
-------->8--
